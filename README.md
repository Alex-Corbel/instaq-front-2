This project is the "Front - VueJS" component on the previous image.

It's in relation with keycloak as IAM. You need to create a Keycloak ream and replace credentials in keycloak.json
<br/>
The API is created with hasura which provided an GraphQL API directly by scanning a PostgreSQL database.

A stich of hasura as been created in typescript (NodeJs) which call google vision API to check image level content and upload it on S3 web storage then stored in postgre via hasura.
